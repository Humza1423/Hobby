        <hr>
        <p>I like to play all sorts of sports. Many people like one sport and stick to it, however, I love all sports that i can play and i master or get really good at each one of them. People say I just have a talent of getting really good at sports that I havent played before because I just have that athletic spirit. Right now, I am excersising a lot and keep getting a lot of pain and I have one knee injury, however, once all that is done and I am fit again, I would get right back into sports like before. </p>

        <h1>Volleyball</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I started playing volleyball when I was in grade 3/4. The two main reasons why I started volleyball was because of my brother and an anime that I love. My brother played volleyball in grade 7 and 8. I went to a bunch of his matches and I got inspired. There was also this anime called Haikyuu that played a big part in my journey of volleyball. Haikyuu is based on a short boy who also got inspired from other short volleyball players. However, the main character is special as he jumps very high making up for his height. He always had a disadvantage but he still managed to beat the best of the best. I connected myself with this character because I have the same psychological and physical characteristics as him. </p>
        <br>
        <p>This is the anime that inspired me to play volleyball. You can click on it and it will lead you to its Wikipedia page.</p>
